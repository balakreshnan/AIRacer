# AIRacer
Artificial Intelligence learning platform with IoT and Mixed Reality combined. Learn AI with fun.

## Introduction
Create a reinforcement/Deep learning platform for autonomous driving and other AI use cases. Platform should allow any one to program and build autonoumous driving machines and improve by adding new features. Start with driving machines and then go into Robotics as well.

> Project is only for development purpose.
